##Communications
###Communicating with CSUS in 2014-2015

We are introducing new ways to communicate with CSUS. The first of these is through the Facebook group, [here](). The second is the GitHub, a link for which can again be [here](). You may still use the traditional CSUS email addresses (insert here) to contact any one of us individually.

The chief importance of this change is that everybody can now see all the issues council is currently involved with. To see all the issues we're looking at right now, click [here](). If you want to contact CSUS about a problem and you're not comfortable posting it publicly then please, please submit your concern as an issue on the GitHub.

Lastly on communication, consider joining the McGill Computer Science Facebook group [here](). This is an active community, and, while there is a lot of trolling and buffoonery, it's a good place to find out what's going on. We will be emailing you without any particular frequency next year. There won't be a weekly email. 

<!-- No weekly emails? -->

We'll contact you if we have something interesting to say or feel there's something you should know about.

###Diversity Rep and Committee
Organizing a committee with representatives for diversity within the McGill CS community.

In the past, it hasn't been council's job to work towards improving diversity at McGill, but this year we'd like to put some emphasis on diversity.

<!-- Unecessary: This is awesome for us, but the problem is it doesn't seem to be anybody's job except top level mcgill's... and they just got us wrecked in global newspapers for forcing the issuance of that ridiculous "microaggression" apology.

so whose job is it? now it's council's job to figure out how to work diversity and inclusivity better into computer science at mcgill 

Had you asked me a couple months ago whether we needed a team devoted to diversity, i'd likely have scoffed a bit, but --->

In the past few weeks, the council has noticed some minorities in CS aren't as comfortable as we assume. 

<!-- if you talk to the women and some of the minorities in CS here whether or not they're comfortable, you might discover that people aren't really as comfortable here as we think. -->

So what can we do to help? 

<!-- i, like many of you, think the idea of a "microaggression" is rubbish and ultimately harmful to inclusivity, as well as political correctness in many instances, bickering over whether this or that word is appropriate doing little but generating resentment on all sides. 

Being inclusive isn't about being politically correct or overtly racist. it isn't about microaggressions. it's really much simpler than that: does everyone feel comfortable in mcgill computer science. -->
