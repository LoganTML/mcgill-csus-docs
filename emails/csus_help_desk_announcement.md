###CSUS Help Desk Announcement

Just like last year, CSUS will be hosting an undergraduate help desk for students who want help in their COMP courses! At the moment we don't have a set schedule for the tutoring hours, but once we do, you'll know right away! We're going to be helping out students with all introductory COMP courses; that includes COMP 202, 206, 208, 250, 251, 252, and 273. Depending on the tutor, you might even be able to ask questions about 300+ level courses. Check out our desk on the third floor of Trottier and good luck with all of your courses!
