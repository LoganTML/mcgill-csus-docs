Hey Dudes,

There are a few things to talk about.
They've been sectioned off below so that you can read the parts you think are relevant to you.
We haven't figured out how best to send out these emails yet, but we are working towards a method by which students who don't want to receive these emails can opt out.
Having said that, each of the listserv emails will be fairly brief and clearly sectioned so that you can read relevant information.


# Positions in CSUS

Nomination forms for CSUS positions are available in front of the student lounge.
We are looking for new:

VP Admin
VP External
U1 Representative
VP Diversity
Comp Bio Rep
Comp Maths Rep
Comp Phys Rep
any other position you think we need!

Pick up the form and put it back, filled in, in the same folder from which you retrieved the original by Monday, the 15th of September.
We will gather these forms on Tuesday and start contacting people for interviews and discussions about the positions.
If you filled out a form and got signatures, send us an email at csus@cs.mcgill.ca about it, and we'll get things sorted out.


# Diversity Welcome Lunch

There will be a lunch hosted by the Diversity Group on Friday in McConnell 103 from 12:00 to 13:30. 
We will talk about what kind of events and topics we want to focus on this year regarding diversity in the Tech/CS sector, especially in the School of Computer Science.


# Hardware Workshops

We are planning hardware workshops.
This will involve up to 5000CAD in fundraising and a small team to organise the workshops themselves.
The goal is to involve companies in providing workshops for working with basic hardware as well as purchasing a collection of hardware that CSUS can keep and loan to students, such as Raspberry Pi's, Arduinos, and Meshbees.
If you know a company that would be interested in sponsoring or are interested in helping with the event, email either Calem, Maude, or Zili.


# CSUS HELP DESK

As last year, CSUS will be hosting an undergraduate help desk for students who want help in their COMP courses.
Tutors will provide help in coursework and homework, and answer any general questions about CS at McGill!
At the moment we don't have a set schedule for the tutoring hours.
However, the current goal is to start on September 15th on Monday to Thursday from 1pm to 5pm.
The help desk is situated on the third floor of Trottier by the glass pods.

In order to increase the hours of operation and be able to help more people, we'll be needing more tutors! 

What do I need to become a CSUSHD Tutor?
> Tutors must have taken some of the following classes: COMP 202, 206, 273, 250/251.  They will also have to pass a short interview.

If I sign up as a tutor, how much responsibility do I have? 
> Tutors will be responsible for at least 1 hour a week of scheduled tutor time.

Why should I be a tutor?
> You will get a signed letter from Gregory Dudek recognizing your hours of tutoring work at the end of each semester as a tutor which is great for CV building.  
You will also get the opportunity to help your fellow Computer Science students and make friendships with other tutors and students.
(Also for warm fuzzies.  Warm fuzzies are usually worth it if you have the time.)

How do I sign up?
