hey guys,

this isn't really a listserv, it's a list of positions that we'd like to fill and a brief summary of some of the stuff we hope to do this year.
i'm going to keep this short, sweet, and skimmable.
the positions are summarised so that interested individuals can apply.
the brief summary is so that interested individuals can help.
we're going to need all the help we can get.
if there's something you think there should be that csus doesn't have or isn't yet, let us know.

## the available positions

+ vp external - maxim will be leaving once the new constitution is passed to pursue work.  external maintains industry and other outside relationships and is president in the president's absence.  i'd say that's pretty damn vital. 
+ vp diversity - a new position.  what can we realistically do to improve our diversity and accepting nature?  it's a weighty question.  i don't know.  do you?
+ u1 representative - as the title would suggest, the primary job is to represent u1 interests.  you get involved in everything, though.
+ vp events - another new position.  keeping track of events is really hard.  it looks like we're going to have some amazing support from the career centre and a few other places, but a dedicate vp position to support events seems appropriate all the same.  you would be in charge of making events run smoothly.  this will include both academic events and stuff like barbecues.


## potential plans and events for this year

+ hardware workshops - have you worked with hardware before?  if you haven't, it looks hard.  well, it isn't, and we'll prove it to you.  we also hope to get a collection of hardware that can be loaned out to students for projects.
+ more student research - "that doesn't sound like an event or a plan!"  you're right, astute reader, it isn't.  i'm working on how we accomplish this goal.  the first thing is to get more people exploring with 396 projects.  what comes after that?  i don't know.  but publishing a paper is a tremendous experience and very informative, so increasing the number of studen papers in good journals seems like a good direction.
