Hey guys,

This isn't really a listserv, it's a list of positions that we'd like to fill and a brief summary of some of the stuff we hope to do this year.
I'm going to keep this short, sweet, and skimmable.
The positions are summarised so that interested individuals can apply.
The brief summary is so that interested individuals can help.
We're going to need all the help we can get.
If there's something you think there should be that csus doesn't have or isn't yet, let us know.

##Available positions

+ VP External - Maxim will be leaving once the new constitution is passed to pursue work.  External maintains industry and other outside relationships and is president in the president's absence. This position is vital to the functioning of the Computer Science Undergraduate Society as a whole.
+ VP Diversity - This is a new position that came about due to discussion on the Facebook McGill CS Group.  What can we realistically do to improve our diversity and accepting nature?  It's a weighty question.  If you know, and you have some serious ideas for helping computer science become a more welcoming, more diverse environment, you should apply to this position.
+ U1 representative - As the title would suggest, the primary job is to represent U1  student interests.  As a representative, you are able involved in all CSUS affairs.
+ VP Events - Another new position.  Keeping track of events is really hard.  It looks like we're going to have some amazing support from the career centre and a few other places, but a dedicate VP position to support events seems appropriate all the same.  You would be in charge of making events run smoothly.  This will include both academic events and stuff like barbecues. This technically falls under the role of VP Internal and should the current VP External choose to accept the responsibility involved with these tasks, this position will become unavailable.


## Potential plans and Events for this year

+ Hardware Workshops - Have you worked with hardware before?  If you haven't, it looks hard.  Well, it isn't, and we'll prove it to you!  We also hope to get a collection of hardware that can be loaned out to students for projects. This would hopefully involve sponsor involvement and could lead students to discover employment opportunities in fields where programming is done close to the hardware. 
+ More student research - "That doesn't sound like an event or a plan!"  You're right, astute reader, it isn't.  I'm working on how we accomplish this goal.  
  + The first thing is to get more people exploring with 396 projects.  What comes after that?  I don't know.  but publishing a paper is a tremendous experience and very informative, so increasing the number of studen papers in good journals seems like a good direction.
  + Student research can be very valuable when combined with other interests. For instance, studies are just emerging now of the effect computers and computer science are having in different groups within modern societies.
